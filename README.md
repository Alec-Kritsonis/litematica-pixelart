# litematica-pixelart

1. This is an extension to Masa's fabric-litematica program. All credit to him.
Base source code here: https://github.com/maruohon/litematica/tree/temp_1.17_update

2. How to use:
It is an additional menu/option in the litematica menu and follows the same structure to create a schematic, however rather than saving the area in the world
the program uses a specified image file path and a specified block pallet path to make a pixel art of the image out of the blocks you put in the pallet file.
This requires absolute file path (ex: "C:\Users\aleck\Pictures\Saved Pictures\glass_fog").
